This summer I will be interning as a Software Engineer at [Aidoc](http://www.aidoc.com/), an Israeli company based in Tel Aviv. Aidoc 
focuses on machine learning solutions that detect abnormalities in various medical scans to assist radiologists in diagnosing potentially 
dangerous phenomena.

I will be detailing my experiences in working for Aidoc this summe where I'll be focusing on machine learning solutions and whichever
stack I will be working with.  Stay tuned for more updates this summer (and more sandy photos).
