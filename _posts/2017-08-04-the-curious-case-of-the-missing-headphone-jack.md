When the iPhone 7 was announced on September 7, 2016, the greatest outrage did not surround the lack of improvement from the previous iteration's
internal hardware or even the common complaints about the (slowdown of past generations of iPhones after major software updates)[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/upshot/hold-the-phone-a-big-data-conundrum.html?_r=1].
Rather, the iPhone 7 became the (*iPhone Without a Headphone Jack*)[https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/09/apple-introduces-iphone-7-iphone-7-plus/].

A myriad of questions sprung up immediately after the announcement. Would audio manufacturers switch to Apple's Lightning input
and drop the industry-standard 3.5mm headphone input? Would Apple pay the price for removing the headphone jack and alienating customers with
not ready to search for new headphones?

The answers to those questions? No and no. Apple chose to package a 3.5mm to Lightning adapter with the iPhone 7 to accomodate users and headphone manufacturers
unwilling to switch to Apple's new self-proclaimed standard. However, the damage to the user experience was uncurable. The Lightning input became an annoyance 
to most iPhone 7 users as they could no longer enjoy the convenience of charging the device and listening to audio through wired headphones, forced some users 
to opt for Bluetooth headphones (a flawed experience to say the least), and ultimately made most users deal with the odd extension of the adapter.

The decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone became a means by which Apple forced users to deal with tech's greatest sin (discomfort) or buy into 
Apple's proprietary Lightning input and become fully integrated into the Apple ecosystem.

Lately, the most alarming news to many smartphone consumers has been the adoption of Apple's 3.5mm headphone jack removal philosophy by many smartphone companies 
developing Android phones. Motorola's Moto Z, HTC's U Ultra, and (most worryingly the new Google Pixel 2)[https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/890157163347406848] (flagship Android smartphone developed by Google themselves) have all done away with the 3.5mm headphone jack.
However, instead of choosing to create their own proprietary headphone inputs, each Android manufacturer has included a single USB-C jack to combine 
charging, data transfer, and audio output into a single port.

Is this move hypocritical of Google after (publicly releasing ads poking fun at Apple for removing the 3.5mm headphone input?)[https://youtu.be/Rykmwn0SMWU?t=43s] 
The answer to that would be a hard *yes*. Is the decision to use an standard USB-C port rather than a Apple-limited Lightning port as anti-consumer as Apple's decision? 
Arguably so.

While the fear of manufacturers creating their own audio input standards has likely passed, the consequences will likely remain the same. WHile headphone manufacturers continue 
to stick to their 3.5mm standard and smartphone manufacturers stay fragmented over their input of choice, the smartphone and headphone markets will 
be an exhausting process for consumers having to adapt to different standards between different companies.

In theory, merging multiple ports with different uses into a single port streamlines the smartphone experience. But until all smartphone manufacturers agree 
on a single standard (much like the adoption of Bluetooth as the standard to connect to nearby wireless accessories), the headphone experience for consumers 
looking to purchase a new smartphone will be uncomfortable at the very least.
