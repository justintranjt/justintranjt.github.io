At Aidoc, the dev team is small, tight-knit, and intently focused on shipping out their product as it is built for their specific purposes. Creating usable, revolutionary tech is no small feat in the medical world. With a host of restrictions from highly-secured hospital internet networks to limiting American HIPAA regulations, the 4-person dev team at Aidoc has to be clever in designing its technological architecture.

This dev team does not just code, they design and create. That is why the team is so intent on being software engineers rather than mere programmers. For this primary reason, Princeton's COS courses have surprisingly prepared me well for working as an integral member of a startup dev team. It is not simply a matter of utilizing the correct SDK and searching through an API for juuuust the right method to apply to an algorithm.

Rather, Princeton's curriculum gets students thinking critically about systems and applications (and sometimes even the mathematical underpinnings). Is it essential to have a highly theoretical Computer Science degree to succeed as a software engineer at a high-tech company? No. Does it help the decision-making process when making important systems decisions? Most definitely, yes.

But I digress. I'm here to speak on my experience in Israel, not just the experience of working at a software engineering internship that happens to be in Israel. 

Before arriving in Israel, the single most-preached token of advice was "expect Israelis to be blunt". For all that various programs and locals preach about the "Israeli straightforwardness" in order to prepare sheltered Ivy League university students, there is more similarity than one may expect half a world away in the Middle East. 

At the end of the day, software engineers share similar customs, personalities, and attitudes toward technology and life no matter where you go around the world. Maybe that says more about the human condition than it does about the differences that can be observed between cultures. Once you dig deep and start speaking to Israelis on the hard topics, you may find that they share similar values but simply expressed in different ways based on their culture.
