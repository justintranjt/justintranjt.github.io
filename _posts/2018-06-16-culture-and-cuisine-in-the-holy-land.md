I don't enjoy traveling alone. I can't fully explore something without a push in the right direction. So how the hell did I end up in the Middle East? Simply put, individuals with no relationship with any form of organized religion rarely, if ever, choose to visit Israel. With as little relation as I have to Israel, a country comprised of 75% Jews and 21% Arabs (and of which I am neither), the greatest dilemma involves understanding a foreign culture that I have no prior interaction with.

Travel is imperfect yet exhilirating in this sense. The major question all travelers should ask themselves applies heavily in this case: "How can I understand a culture without being a member of it?"

My answer? We break bread and eat. 

Eat at the sit-down, tip-your-waiter and keep-the-table-spotless restaurants headed by chefs with years of experience cooking for the finest patrons in the world.

Eat at the neighborhood street food joints that are little more than a grill and cash register operated by a lone, weathered man that has served thousands upon thousands of soft, fluffy layers of pita along with the deliciously fried balls of falafel that could only be made with love and the soul to continue perfecting a single dish for years.

They are one in the same.

This is not just a 10 week vacation. This is work and cultural understanding in the making. Work with the people, eat with the people, and pretty soon, understand how wildly distant ideas can work in the world.
