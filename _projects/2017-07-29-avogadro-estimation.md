I will go ahead and explain the science behind my final COS 126 Project here and provide a [link to the project repo](https://github.com/justintranjt/avogadro-estimate). This assignment was created by David Botstein, Tamara Broderick, Ed Davisson, Daniel Marlow, William Ryu, and Kevin Wayne of Princeton University in 2005 and was personally completed in Spring 2017.

We'll start off with the idea of "Brownian Motion", a physical phenomenon
