# Why build Thrive Goals?
Our software helps people break large projects down into manageable subgoals in a goal hierarchy, reducing procrastination and making work more enjoyable and intrinsically motivating. Our system provides users with modifiable templates created by learning specialists and other students to help them structure their work processes for major assignments like papers and coding projects. The software helps people track goal completion through progress measures like a taskbar, so that even when progress is small, users can still feel assured they are making progress.

Thrive is targeted at Princeton University students and is therefore gated by Princeton's CAS authentication server.
