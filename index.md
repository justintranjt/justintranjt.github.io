<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class="meta">Updated August 14, 2024 2:12 PM | By Justin Tran</p>

Welcome to my page! I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Roblox on the Developer Monetization team where I work with all things related to Robux, the platform's virtual currency! I graduated from Princeton University in 2020 with a degree in Computer Science and a certificate in Asian American Studies.

I'm a computer scientist by education, a software engineer by trade, and an Oregonian from the day I was born. Here is some background on my interests and motivations:

Ever since I picked up my first Game Boy Color as a young child, I have always loved gaming and technology. I not only continued to enjoy gaming, but also used it as an inspiration to throw myself fully into programming in the hopes that I could inspire users the same way I was inspired from a young age. Today, I hope to use that passion as a developer to explore the many odd categories of the world that interest me. Currently, that odd category includes payment processing systems and financial technology which are direct extensions of my day-to-day domain at work!

Whether those interests are related to [analyzing musical sampling patterns with network analysis](https://justintranjt.me/projects/2019-05-07-Music-Sampling-Networks/) or investigating the [effects of nature conservation in Namibia](https://justintranjt.github.io/research/), everything can be broken down and analyzed.

Today, my time is divided among developing projects that stimulate my mind (with Android Apps as the next bullet on my list), cheering for the [Portland Trail Blazers](https://thefader-res.cloudinary.com/private_images/w_1260,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:best/D46OaxbW0AA0mbU_hteq5o/damian-lillard-portland-trail-blazers-game-winner-blog.jpg), and tinkering with [mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/).

In the past, I've poured my energy into building the Esports community at Princeton University as the President of [Princeton Esports](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ptonesports/), tested the latest [Android ROMs and Kernels](https://forum.xda-developers.com/google-nexus-5), contributed to the [crash routing protocols at Aidoc Medical](https://justintranjt.me/projects/2018-08-31-POC/), and implemented the digital codes system for [selling Roblox Gift Cards on Amazon](https://justintranjt.me/blog/2019-08-10-Roblox-Retrospective/).

Gaming continues to inspire me as I hope to contribute to the industry by building and improving upon groundbreaking platforms like many innovators before me (for instance, at [Roblox](https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/07/roblox-hits-90-million-monthly-users-as-european-growth-picks-up/)). In whatever segment of the tech industry I may become passionate about working in, the drive to improve and innovate as a developer will be present due to the inspiration I've received from being a part of the gaming industry.

For my thoughts on the current state of Esports, the Android ecosystem, or other oddities I will inevitably become enamored with, head over to my [blog](https://justintranjt.github.io/blog/) to see what is on my mind. If you prefer to view my latest coding projects, take a look at my write-ups on the [projects page](https://justintranjt.github.io/projects/) and check out the full source code (for said projects and this very website) [on GitHub](https://github.com/justintranjt).
