<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class="meta">July 26, 2017 12:29 PM | By Justin Tran</p>

Welcome to my page! I'm a computer scientist by education, a Princetonian at the moment, and an Oregonian from the day I was born. Here is some background on my interests and motivations:

Ever since I picked up my first Game Boy Color as a young child, I have always loved gaming and technology. I not only continued to enjoy gaming, but also used it as an inspiration to throw myself fully into programming in the hopes that I could inspire users the same way I was inspired from a young age. Today, I hope to use that passion as a developer to explore the many odd categories of the world that interest me.

Whether those interests are related to [approximating Avogadro's Number with experimental methods](https://justintranjt.github.io/projects/2017-07-29-avogadro-estimation/) using my coding chops or investigating the [effects of nature conservation in Namibia](https://justintranjt.github.io/research/), all of those explorations can be found on this website.

Gaming continues to inspire me as I hope to contribute to the industry by building and improving upon groundbreaking platforms like so many innovators before me (for instance, at Twitch). Wherever I may end up, the drive to improve and innovate as a developer in a new or old industry will be present. No industry is stagnant and no barriers are present with the correct entrepreneurial mindset during development.

Today, my interests are divided among developing projects that stimulate my mind, continuing to build the eSports community at Princeton University as the acting President of [Princeton eSports](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ptonesports/), browsing the latest [Android ROMs and Kernels](https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-3), and looking for the optimal solution to my next programming assignment.

For my thoughts on the latest in eSports, the Android ecosystem, my latest travels, or other oddities I will inevitably become enamored with, head over to my [blog](https://justintranjt.github.io/blog/) to see what is on my mind. If you prefer to view my latest projects, take a look at my write-ups on the [projects page](https://justintranjt.github.io/projects/) and check out the full source code (for those projects and this very website) [on GitHub](https://github.com/justintranjt).
