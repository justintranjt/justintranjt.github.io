<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class="meta">July 26, 2017 12:29 PM | By Justin Tran</p>

Welcome to my page! I'm a computer scientist by education, a Princetonian at the moment, and an Oregonian from the day I was born.

Ever since I picked up my first Game Boy Color as a young child, I have always loved gaming and technology. Like many individuals my age, I not only continued to enjoy gaming, but used it as an inspiration to throw myself fully into programming. Today, I hope to use that passion I first gained from gaming in my own programming as I continue to explore the many odd categories of the world that interest me.

One of the greatest blessings I have grown up with is the maturation of the gaming industry to be more than childsplay. Not only is it a full-blown industry now, but it has the ability to be meaningful and productive to many individuals like me. Gaming continues to inspire me as I hope to contribute to the gaming industry by building and improving on platforms for growth in the industry like so many innovators before me have done (for instance, at Twitch). Wherever I may end up, the drive to improve and innovate as a developer in a new or old industry will be present.

Whether those interests are related to approximating Avogadro's Number using my coding chops or investigating the effects of nature conservation in Namibia, all of those explorations can be found on this website.

Today, my interests are divided among creating projects that stimulate my mind, finding time to play Overwatch, building the eSports community at Princeton University as the acting President of Princeton eSports, and all the while working on my next programming assignment or American Studies paper.
